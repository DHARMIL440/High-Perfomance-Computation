# 2D Scattered Data Interpolation using Bilinear Scheme

This project implements **bilinear interpolation** of scattered 2D data points onto a structured mesh grid using a method inspired by **Cloud-in-a-Cell (CIC)** ‚Äî a widely adopted approach in particle-mesh simulations within physics and high-performance computing (HPC).

The problem is modeled as a **"Similar Charge in Cloud"** scenario, where values (e.g., charge, mass) from unstructured positions are deposited onto a structured computational domain. This concept is fundamental for efficient and accurate numerical simulations in scientific and engineering applications.

## üìå Problem Description

Given a set of scattered points $(x_i, y_i, f_i)$, where $f_i = 1$, the goal is to interpolate function values onto a structured grid of size $M \times M$ using **bilinear interpolation** following the **CIC (Cloud-in-a-Cell)** method.

Each scattered point contributes to the values of the four nearest grid points based on its relative distance to them.

## üß† Applications

This interpolation scheme finds broad application in the following domains:

1. **Computer Graphics & 3D Modeling**

   * Smooth surface generation from point clouds (e.g., from LIDAR or photogrammetry).
   * Example: Converting a scanned 3D object into a renderable mesh.

2. **Scientific Visualization**

   * Interpolating sensor data (e.g., temperature, pressure) for visualization in fields like meteorology or oceanography.

3. **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**

   * Mapping scattered experimental or physical data onto a structured mesh for numerical simulations (e.g., stress analysis, CFD).

4. **Medical Imaging**

   * Reconstructing anatomical surfaces or volumes from scattered MRI/CT data.

5. **Machine Learning & Data Science**

   * Transforming sparse or uneven data into continuous grids for regression, analysis, or modeling tasks.

## üßÆ Cloud-in-a-Cell (CIC) ‚Äì Charge Deposition

Each scattered point within a grid cell (bounded by corners $(X_i, Y_j)$, $(X_{i+1}, Y_j)$, etc.) contributes to surrounding grid points using bilinear weights:

$$
\begin{aligned}
w_{i,j} &= (1 - dx)(1 - dy) \\
w_{i+1,j} &= dx(1 - dy) \\
w_{i,j+1} &= (1 - dx)dy \\
w_{i+1,j+1} &= dxdy
\end{aligned}
$$

Where:

$$
dx = \frac{x_i - X_i}{\Delta x}, \quad dy = \frac{y_i - Y_j}{\Delta y}
$$

These weights ensure smooth, conservative deposition across the grid.

## üöÄ Performance and Optimization Goals

This project not only emphasizes accuracy but also aims for **high-performance parallel computation**. Optimization directions include:

* Implement parallel versions (OpenMP, MPI, SIMD)
* Benchmark performance:

  * Execution time
  * Speedup vs. thread count
  * Cache behavior (Valgrind/Callgrind, Intel VTune)
* Evaluate:

  * Impact of hyperthreading
  * Thread scheduling strategies
  * Effects of memory locality

## üìù Notes

* The simulation domain is fixed to $[0, 1] \times [0, 1]$.
* Always validate interpolation results against a reference or analytical benchmark.
* Take care to avoid **race conditions** when parallelizing the algorithm.
